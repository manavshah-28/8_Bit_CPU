# 8_Bit_CPU
## Design an 8 bit CPU in Logisim from the ground up using logic gates. 
Instructor: © Ross MacGowan ( Design a CPU)

### General info
- All subparts of the 8 bit CPU, namely the registers, decoders, RAM, ROM, ALU, etc. are built from scratch using basic combinational gate circuits.
- There are 4 registers namely R0,R1,R2,R3.
- The 8_Bit_CPU.circ file contains the Logisim file of the implemented design.
- An excel Assembler is used to convert Assembly language to machine code which is then added to memory.

### Assembly Language Instructions supported on 8 Bit CPU

### Key learnings
- Computer Architecture
- Logisim software
- Design of computer compoenets such as RAM, ROM, ALU, Registers, Decoders, Clocks, Counters, etc. using basic combinatorial logic gates.
- Instruction Set Architecture
- Assemblers and Assembly Language

### setup 
-The Logisim software works on a java runtime environment. To set up said environment visit (link)[https://www.java.com/en/download/].
-The logisim software can then be run.
